  <p class="mb-4">During the Christmas period some hosts may be taking time off, pubs and venues might have special events, and events may clash with public holidays.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">Please check with event hosts where events may not be running. You can find links to contact hosts by selecting an event and looking for Facebook or Instagram pages. If in doubt please contact <a class="underline" href="mailto:jack@kingbrick.co.uk">jack@kingbrick.co.uk</a> and I will find out for you.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">Leicester Open Mics is ran by myself as a sole volunteer. I am not always able to keep the app up to date. If you notice any events with wrong information please email me <a class="underline" href="mailto:jack@kingbrick.co.uk">jack@kingbrick.co.uk</a> and I will correct the app.</p>
