  <h1 class="text-xl mb-4 font-semibold">About the Leicester Open Mics app</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">The Leicester Open Mics app is a project by <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.jng.me.uk/">Jack Gutteridge</a> and Neil Williamson. We regularly attend open mics in the Leicestershire area.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">We built this app so we wouldn't have to manually keep track of when the next event was on. As comical as it is, we want to put a stop to hosts scrambling around trying to figure out when their next event is at the end of every night!</p>
  <h1 class="text-xl mb-4 font-semibold">Feature your open mic</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">To feature your open mic please email <a class="underline" href="mailto:jack@kingbrick.co.uk">jack@kingbrick.co.uk</a> with details of your event including the venue and schedule and include a natural photo of your hosts at the venue without any text covering the photo.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">To be considered on this website your event should have a Leicestershire postcode or be located near the Leicestershire border. Listings are free of charge.</p>
