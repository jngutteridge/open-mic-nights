  <h1 class="text-xl mb-4 font-semibold">About the Leicester Open Mics app</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">The Leicester Open Mics app is a project by <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.jng.me.uk/">Jack Gutteridge</a> and Neil Williamson. We regularly attend open mics in the Leicestershire area.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">We built this app so we wouldn't have to manually keep track of when the next event was on. As comical as it is, we want to put a stop to hosts scrambling around trying to figure out when their next event is at the end of every night!</p>
